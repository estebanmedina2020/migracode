            <p><strong>Thoughts/religions</strong><br><br>
        Religions are the tool to bind the people on discipline.I do follow a 
        religion but i take it as a part of culture.I believe in being a 
        good human being then being a blind follower. <br><br>
    
        Being financially strong is a good thing to be but contribution
    towards society's well being is also a vital part.I like those peoples
    who fulfil their social responsibilities, who have the sense of WE.</p>
